This bug arises when using `NSDateFormatter` with a date format string that's not properly formatted or doesn't match the locale.  It can lead to unexpected date parsing or formatting results, including crashes or incorrect data manipulation.  Specifically, the issue appears when using a date format string that mixes components without considering locale-specific conventions.
