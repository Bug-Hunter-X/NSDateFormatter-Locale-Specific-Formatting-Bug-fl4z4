# Objective-C NSDateFormatter Locale-Specific Formatting Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using `NSDateFormatter` in Objective-C. The bug stems from incorrect handling of locale-specific date and time format strings, leading to unexpected date parsing or formatting results.

## Bug Description
The `NSDateFormatter` class in Objective-C is powerful but requires careful attention to detail when dealing with various locales and date/time formats.  An improperly formatted date string can lead to inconsistent or incorrect results, sometimes even causing crashes.

This example shows how an incorrectly formatted date string that mixes different style components (e.g., mixing short and long style months) can cause issues, especially across different locales where date/time format conventions vary.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully crafting the `dateFormat` string according to the locale's conventions.  Using consistent date and time component styles will avoid potential discrepancies.  Using a locale-aware approach will provide more robust behavior.
